## 📄  Rationale

The Hushh Wallet MVP is designed as a smart, customizable digital wallet that stores a user’s lifestyle preferences and enables seamless preference-sharing with businesses. The purpose of the prototype is to demonstrate how users can organize their personal data—such as travel habits, food choices, allergens, shopping preferences, and lifestyle details—in a clean, modern, and simple interface.

Each preference category is represented as a separate card. These cards are intentionally designed with bold colors, glossy highlights, rounded corners, and minimal text to make them visually distinct and easy to scan. The overall design direction focuses on clarity, personalization, and smooth navigation. The layout reduces cognitive load, keeps actions minimal, and ensures the user always understands what they are editing or sharing.

The central feature of the MVP is QR-based data sharing. In real-life use, a store, hotel, restaurant, or travel operator can scan the user’s QR code and instantly view only the preferences that the user chooses to share. This maintains user privacy while enabling businesses to deliver personalized experiences.

The UI avoids traditional “credit/debit card” styling and instead adopts a more modern, customizable look. This allows each user to give personality and uniqueness to their profile. Colors, icons, and spacing have been chosen to feel friendly, youthful, and less corporate.

Overall, the Hushh Wallet MVP highlights personalization, secure data control, and effortless preference management. It is a strong foundation for scaling into a full product with more categories, deeper customization, and intelligent recommendations.
